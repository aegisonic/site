At Aegisonic, we are developing an adaptive audio headset designed to support individuals with heightened sound sensitivity, with a particular focus on the autistic community. Our goal is to address the shortage of effective, purpose-built solutions by creating a headset that reduces perceived volume and narrows harsh dynamic ranges, ultimately providing a more comfortable and equitable sonic experience for all.

## Confronting a sonically inaccessible world

Decreased Sound Tolerance (DST) is a significant challenge within the 60-million-person autism community. An estimated 40–50% of this population experiences hyperacusis or misophonia, which can result in a 3–4× louder perception of high-volume sounds compared to the general population. For those with autism and DST, the world’s loud and unpredictable sounds are often experienced as painful and intolerable. Important activities such as going to the doctor, riding public transportation, or being aware of a baby's cry can become major sensory challenges. For many, the resulting stress becomes a barrier, deterring them from receiving medical care, commuting to work, or starting a family.

## Market shortcomings

For most people, adaptive noise canceling (ANC) headphones or earplugs provide sufficient protection from sudden, unwanted sound, but not for those with highest acoustic sensitivity. Earmuffs — like those worn for construction — offer more protection and are often recommended for those with autism, but users report that they apply too much pressure to be worn comfortably for extended periods of time. 

## Our solution

Aegisonic uses a proprietary adaptive sound-processing system designed to reduce the intensity of harsh or unpredictable sounds while giving users intuitive control over their listening environment through a single dial. By integrating this technology into an affordable, comfortable headset, we aim to make even the noisiest settings — from busy cities to everyday homes — more accessible for everyone.
