Aegisonic is a project founded as part of Mt. Sinai 2025 Pitch Day, seeking to address the clear lack of a market solution for those with heightened sound sensitivity with a headset designed to provide an equitable sonic experience for all. 

## Confronting a sonically inaccessible world

Decreased Sound Tolerance (DST) is a significant challenge for those with Autism, affecting approximately 60M people globally — 1 in 45 adults, and 1 in 31 children. 40%-50% of this population experience hyperacusis or misophonia, meaning they perceive loud sounds as 3-4x louder than the general population.
For those with Autism and DST, the world is full of loud, unpredictable noise that high levels of stress. For those who experience hyperacusis or misophonia, the sounds of a doctor's office, public transportation, or a baby's cry, create significant challenges. For many, the resultant stress is a barrier, meaning they are deterred from receiving medical treatment, riding transit to work, and starting a family. 

## Market shortcomings

For most people, adaptive noise canceling (ANC) headphones or earplugs provide sufficient protection from sudden, unwanted sound, but not for those with highest acoustic sensitivity. Earmuffs — like those worn at gun ranges — offer more protection, but apply too much pressure to be worn comfortably for extended periods of time. 

## Our solution

With new techniques for adaptable sound processing, and a research and development effort focused on autistic experience, our headset will create an affordable, accessible means for navigating in our noisy world, and ensuring that no part of life — for parenthood to healthcare — is inaccessible due to sound.
