      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aegisonic is a project founded as part of Mt. Sinai 2025 Pitch Day, seeking to address the clear lack of a market solution for those with heightened sound sensitivity with a headset designed to provide an equitable sonic experience for all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;confronting-a-sonically-inaccessible-world&#34;&gt;Confronting a sonically inaccessible world&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Decreased Sound Tolerance (DST) is a significant challenge for those with Autism, affecting approximately 60M people globally — 1 in 45 adults, and 1 in 31 children. 40%-50% of this population experience hyperacusis or misophonia, meaning they perceive loud sounds as 3-4x louder than the general population.&#xA;For those with Autism and DST, the world is full of loud, unpredictable noise that high levels of stress. For those who experience hyperacusis or misophonia, the sounds of a doctor&amp;rsquo;s office, public transportation, or a baby&amp;rsquo;s cry, create significant challenges. For many, the resultant stress is a barrier, meaning they are deterred from receiving medical treatment, riding transit to work, and starting a family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
